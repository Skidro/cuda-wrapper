/*
 * This program implements the call interface to acquire and release GPU locks. 
 * It is implemented as a library that is compiled and linked with the
 * cuda wrappers dynamic load module (see the Makefile).  It can also be 
 * compiled and linked with a Cuda program for using the lock calls directly
 * in a program instead of using the wrappers.  Each process (including those
 * that create threads) effectively has a copy of this program.
 *
 * The library depends on a shared memory segment (allocated and initialized by
 * the GPU_Locks.c program) that contains the global GPU locks implemented by
 * shared POSIX mutexes.  The shared segment contains the mutex implementation of 
 * GPU CE (copy engine) and EE (execution engine) Locks. 
 * Currently there are only two locks/mutexes supporting a single
 * copy and execute engine pair as found in the NVIDIA Jetson
 * TK1 which has an integrated GPU.  Adding support for a second
 * copy engine as would be typical for a discrete GPU should be trivial.
 *
 * State is maintained for the locks to enforce the rule that a process may only
 * hold one of the locks at a time (no deadlocks allowed).  The rule that a lock
 * can be held by only one process is enforced by the POSIX mutex implementation.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Assumes that processes will create threads only with the POSIX 
 * API call pthread_create() and not use a system call like clone() directly.
 *
 * Note that all calls have a void return.  If a call returns to the caller, it
 * can assume that the call completed correctly.  If any error occurs, the process
 * is terminated.
