/*
 * This program implements the API to acquire and release GPU locks. 
 * It is implemented as a library that is compiled and linked with the
 * cuda wrappers dynamic load module (see the Makefile).  It can also be 
 * compiled and linked with a Cuda program for using the lock calls directly
 * in a program instead of using the wrappers.  Each process (including those
 * that create threads) effectively has a copy of this program.
 *
 * The library uses the kernel loadable module, GPU_Locks.c, that contains the 
 * mutex implementation of GPU CE (copy engine) and EE (execution engine) Locks. 
 * Currently there are only two locks/mutexes supporting a single
 * copy and execute engine pair as found in the NVIDIA Jetson
 * TK1 which has an integrated GPU.  Adding support for a second
 * copy engine as would be typical for a discrete GPU should be trivial.
 *
 * The interface to the kernel module is implemented as a "virtual" file
 * in the debugfs file system (usually) mounted at /sys/kernel/debug.
 * Basically a system-call-like API is provided by writing a string
 * identifying the requested operation into the "virtual" file that has
 * a name that is shared by the library and kernel module.  The write
 * operation on this file is actually implemented in the kernel module
 * which is passed a buffer pointer containing the request string.  If
 * an error condition is found by the kernel module, the return value 
 * is < 0 and the calling process is terminated (see the do_syscall()
 * function. 
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Assumes that processes will create threads only with the POSIX 
 * API call pthread_create() and not use a system call like clone() directly.
 *
 * Note that all calls have a void return.  If a call returns to the caller, it
 * can assume that the call completed correctly.  If any error occurs, the process
 * is terminated.
