Sample bash scripts for running the vectorAdd benchmark with no
GPU locking.  The naming conventon is run_X_S.sh where X is the 
number of processes to run concurrently and S indicates the Linux 
scheduling class to be used for the process(es) -- SO is SCHED_OTHER 
with the default nice value, SF is SCHED_FIFO with equal priorities, 
and SFP is SCHED_FIFO with successively higher priority assigned to 
each process run by the script.  The Linux command chrt is used to
set the scheduling class and priorities for SCHED_FIFO.  The process(es) 
run in background and redirect stderr to a file named log.
