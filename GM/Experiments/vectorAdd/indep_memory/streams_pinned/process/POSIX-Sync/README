Sample bash scripts for running the vectorAdd benchmark with user
space GPU locking implemented by POSIX mutex functions.  The naming
conventon is run_X_S.sh where X is the number of processes to
run concurrently and S indicates the Linux scheduling class to
be used for the process(es) -- SO is SCHED_OTHER with the default
nice value, SF is SCHED_FIFO with equal priorities, and SFP is 
SCHED_FIFO with successively higher priority assigned to each
process run by the script.  The Linux command chrt is used to
set the scheduling class and priorities for SCHED_FIFO.
The process(es) run in background and redirect stderr to a file
named log.

The full path to the wrapper library libcudart_wrapper.so in the
LD_PRELOAD should be set correctly for the GPU locking code
directory structure.

These scripts MUST be run with the sync level parameter (values
0 (Spin), 1 (Yield), or 2 (Block).
